# spencer-projects
A collection of coding projects I have made during my undergrad for classes, past co-op work, and volunteer work.
All of the code included here was written in Python using either Python notebooks or PyCharm, but all have been converted to notebooks for ease of viewing plots.

My most recent code for class assignments/projects is in 'Phys411_FinalProject_Plovie', and my most recent co-op/volunteer work is in both 'SF_Plots_General' and 'coadd_maps'.
All code for 'Phys321A' documents is numerical integration methods involving ordinary differential equations used in classical mechanics.
