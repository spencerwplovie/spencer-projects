# spencer-projects
A collection of coding projects I have made during my undergrad for classes, past co-op work, and volunteer work.
All of the code included here was written in Python using either Python notebooks or PyCharm, but all have been converted to notebooks for ease of viewing.

My most recent code for class assignments/projects is in 'Phys411_FinalProject_Plovie', and my most recent co-op/volunteer work is in both 'SF_Plots_General' and 'coadd_maps'. The former involves analyzing weather station data from the greater Victoria region using methods including probability density functions, power spectral density functions, cross-correlations, spectrograms, and structure functions, and was part of a written report for a time series analysis class. The latter involves analyzing the JCMT transient survey light curve data for deeply embedded protostars, their disks, and prestellar cores using a structure function analysis to search for intrinsic variability timescales.

All code for 'Phys321A' documents is mostly numerical integration methods involving ordinary differential equations used in classical mechanics. I have also included some volunteer research work involving basic analysis of
