# spencer-projects
A collection of coding projects I have made during my undergrad for classes, past co-op work, and volunteer work.
All of the code included here was written in Python using either Python notebooks or PyCharm, but all have been converted to notebooks for ease of viewing.

**My most recent code** for class assignments/projects is in **'Phys411_FinalProject_Plovie'**, and my most recent co-op/volunteer work is in both **'SF_Plots_General'** and **'coadd_maps'**. The former involves analyzing weather station data from the greater Victoria region using methods including probability density functions, power spectral density functions, cross-correlations, spectrograms, and structure functions, and was part of a written report for a time series analysis class. For the latter, 'SF_Plots_General' involves analyzing the JCMT transient survey light curve data for deeply embedded protostars, their disks, and prestellar cores using a structure function analysis to search for intrinsic variability timescales. This was done for up to eight star-forming regions, but the code provided uses the data from only one of these regions to prevent clutter on this page. 'coadd_maps' involves searching for linear substructure in star-forming regions using Hough Transforms on FITS files.

All code for 'Phys321A' documents is mostly numerical integration methods involving ordinary differential equations used in classical mechanics. I have also included some volunteer research work involving finding and analyzing the emission lines of high-redshift galaxies under the names 'project_spt0348' and 'project_spt2052', which is some of my earlier volunteer-based research work.

Thanks for visiting!
