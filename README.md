# spencer-projects #
A collection of coding projects accumulated from past work experience. This repository also includes volunteer research work and class projects/assignments.
Most projects are written in Python (which have been converted to Python notebooks for ease of viewing), but there are also descriptions of projects worked on in MATLAB and some demonstrated work in R.

## Past Work Experience ##
Can be found in the **work_projects** folder.
This includes:
1) Summary of my 2-year term as a Scientific Data Associate at Ocean Networks Canada
2) Project reports from my 3 co-op terms as a Junior Scientific Programmer at Ocean Networks Canada
3) Project report and code samples from my co-op term (and some paid research afterwards) as a Data Analyst Intern at the Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre

## Other Research Work ##
Can be found in the **research_work** folder.
This includes:
1) Summary and code samples from my research work at the Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre

## Class Projects ##
Can be found in the **class_projects** folder.
Code samples and projects from several classes, including:
1) Final project for Time Series Analysis (Phys411)
2) Numerical analysis assignments for Classical Mechanics (Phys321A)
3) Statistical analysis assignment for Probability and Statistics (Stat260)
4) Assignment for Introduction to Astrophysics (Astro250)
